# armbian-fullcone
Builds the armbian kernel with xt_FULLCONENAT module from
https://github.com/Chion82/netfilter-full-cone-nat

Optionally, in a second script, prepares the kernel, modules, and firmware
for being used in an Alpine Linux run-from-ram root.

Configration settings are, unapologetically, for hardware I make use of.
